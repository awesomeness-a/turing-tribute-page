                <p><em>Alan Turing</em></p>
            </div>
            <p>Alan Turing was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.<br><br>Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.</p>

                    <h3>1912</h3>
                    <h2>Born in London, UK</h2>
                    <p>Alan Turing was born in a family of a civil servant and a railway engineer and spent much of his early life separated from his parents who worked in India.</p>

                    <h3>1934</h3>
                    <h2>Graduated at King's College, Cambridge</h2>
                    <p>Upon graduation, he was awarded first-class honours in mathematics. In 1935, at the age of 22, he was elected a Fellow of King's College on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem.</p>

                    <h2>Published "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem"</h2>
                    <p>In 1936, he published Turing's proof which introduced the idea of a <mark id="highlights"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNRDvLACg5Q">"Universal Machine"</a></mark> that could decode and perform any set of instructions if they were representable as an algorithm. This paper has been called "easily the most influential math paper in history". </p>

                    <h3>1939</h3>
                    <h2>Worked on breaking the Enigma code.</h2>
                    <p>In July 1939, the Polish Cipher Bureau passed on crucial information about the Enigma machine, which was used by the Germans to encipher all its military and naval signals. After September 1939, joined by other mathematicians at Bletchley Park, Turing rapidly developed a new machine (the "Bombe") capable of breaking Enigma messages on an industrial scale.</p>

                    <h3>1946</h3>
                    <h2>Designed a first electronic computer</h2>
                    <p>In March 1946, Turing produced a detailed design for what was called the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE.) This was a digital computer in the modern sense, storing programs in its memory. His report emphasised the unlimited range of applications opened up by this technological revolution, and software developments ahead of parallel American developments. Yet his relationship with NPL soured and he left in 1948, before a pilot version of the ACE was made in 1950.</p>

                    <h2>Developed the Turing test</h2>
                    <p>Turing moved to the University of Manchester, where electronic engineers had already demonstrated a very small stored-program computer. Now he focused on the use of computers. His main theme had been in investigating the power of a computer to rival human thought. In 1950, he published a philosophical paper including the idea of an <mark id="highlights"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">"imitation game"</a></mark> for comparing human and machine outputs, now called the Turing Test. This paper remains his best known work and was a key contribution to the field of artificial intelligence.</p>

                    <h2>Published "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis"</h3>
                    <p>The article describes how patterns in nature, such as stripes and spirals, can arise naturally from a homogeneous, uniform state. The theory, which can be called a reaction–diffusion theory of morphogenesis, has become a basic model in theoretical biology. Such patterns have come to be known as <mark id="highlights"><a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cocktail-party-physics/when-math-meets-nature-turing-patterns-and-form-constants/">Turing patterns</a></mark>.</p>

                    <h2>Death</h2>
                    <p>Alan Turing had died from cyanide poisoning at the age of 41. A partly eaten apple lay next to his body. The coroner’s verdict was suicide. His mother argued he had accidentally ingested cyanide during an amateur chemistry experiment, but he had probably planned his death to allow her to think this.</p>
